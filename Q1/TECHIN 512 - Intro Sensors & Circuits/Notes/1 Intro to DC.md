# Introduction

This document will primarily deal with how we ctually provide power to our devices! This is from the first day of class.

# Sensors, Signals, and Systems Overview 

A sensor is a device that detects changes in environment.

There are many things to pay attention to, including:
* Sensor type
    * External / External
* Sensors
    * Noncontact, perceives without physical contact
    * Contact, requires physical contact

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a switch or a gate.

## Sensor - Circuit System

A general typology of a system oriented for heartbeats may look like:

Tiny Signal & Noise > Operational Amplifier > Big signal & Big Noise > Filter Noise (analog) > Big Signal & Smaller Noise > Digitize > Digital Information > Display on Device

## Lab

We will be testing equipment in the lab, including:

* Power Supply
* Multimeter - Detecing / testing batteries
* Oscilloscopes - Enable you to see what the waveform looks like
* Function Generator
