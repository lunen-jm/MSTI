# INtroduction to Protoyping

The prototyping process may follow the following direction:

* Definition
* Design / Refine
* Quick, Low-fi prototyping
* Evaluation / Feedback
* Repeat previous iterative cycle, until low-fidelity protyping is not helpful
* Detailed, High-fi Prototyping
* Repeat previous until done
* Move into production!
