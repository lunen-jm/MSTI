# What is Strategy?

Notes on the What is Strategy document.

## Introduciton & Briefs

**Operational Effectiveness** - How efficient a company is at operating the following activities; creating, producing, selling, and delivering products

While companies may have a competitive advantage in this realm, it is often short lived as it may be easily emulated and adoptable by competitors.

As these best practices are adopted, companies become more homogenous, which is known as **competitive convergence**. Operational effectiveness then increases for all, which means the **productivity frontier** (max value a company can deliver with best practices) allows for value to increase for all. I.e. there is relative improvement for none.

To combat this, companies focus on **strategic positioning**, which is the attempt to preserve what is distinct about a company and performing different activities, or the same activities in different ways.

### Three key principles of strategic positioning

Three key principles support strategic positioning:

1. Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, coming from the following three sources:
    * Serving few, specialized needs for a multitude of customers
    * Serving broad needs of a few customers
    * Serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market
2. Strategy requires you to understand and decide upon trade-offs to better suit your target market and operational capacity. I.e. some gains may only be achieved by reducing capacity within other areas. Sometimes broad growth may lead to shrinkage in certain aspects as well
3. Strategy centers upon creating an overall fit for a company's activities, which means that there needs to be a level of synergy between activities in order for a company to be successful
    * Employees need guidance on ways to deppen the followed strategy for a company
    * Communication and direction for extending uniqueness and strengthening fit is essential
    * Strategy and leadership are intertwined due to this

## Operational Effectiveness is Not Strategy

Traditionally, there has been a focus on being flexible to respond to market changes, benchmarking to analyze oeprations, outsourcing for efficiency, and pillaring a few core competencies to stay ahead. 

While there have been a ton of tools and methods developed to better these operations dramatically, there has been a struggle to translate this to large profit gains.

Cost advantage is the primary result of operational effectiveness, which focuses on better utilization of inputs.

Constrasting with that is strategic positioning which is centered around performing different activities or the same activities in different ways.

As stated earlier, operational effectivness shifts the productivity frontier outward. The productivity frontier is a chart with:
* a y-axis of nonprice buyer value delivered, going from low to high
* an x-axis of relative cost position going from high to low
* A curve connected the high of the y-axis to the low of the x-axis (remember, low on x-axis is actually ghigher value)

Over time, managers have shifted to OE focuses as continuous improvement and cost effectiveness has been the driver of innovation. The result of this however is zero-sum competition and pressure to reduce costs that compromise companies' abilities to invest in the long-term success of their own.

## Strategy Rests on Unique Activities

There are 3 main sources of strategic positioning:

* Variety-based positioning, or producing a subset of an industry's products or services

This is moreso tied to specializing a company to offer limited services or products to better suit their clients.

* Needs-based positioning, or serving most or all needs of a customer base

* Access-based positioning, or a configuration of activities to reach out to a specific location or group of customers
