# Five Forces

The firve forces are:
* Supplier Power
    * Can constrain profits by charging higher prices, counter this by standardizing parts for easier lateral movement between suppliers
* Customer Power
    * Savvy customers can force prices down by going elsewhere, counter this by expanding services so its harder for them to leave
* Established Rivals
    * Keep tabs on them, invest in products that differ to limit price wars
* New Entrants
    * New entrants may join the market with a more lean organization and hunger 
* Substitutes
